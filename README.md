# Alarm_Clock

This project is based on basic python code where 
i've used 4 modules i.e tkinter module, datetime module,
time module, winsound module & threading module.

In this project, I have mainly used tkinter module to create an alarm clock structure.
Threading is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code.
Here, I have created two functions namely threading & alarm.
In order to start the execution of code I have used created threading fuction and 
the alarm function which i created contain the main core of my program where
I set my alarm time and current time using time & datatime modules.

Whenever the current time will be equal to set time the song will start to play.
After that, I have added a button, frame, label & option menu. I have added the hour,
minute and second & created option menu for each of them using option menu method & then used Button
class instance to create a set alarm button.

Finally, I used mainloop method on my main tinkter object to execute tkinter and done

the clock will start ringing on the time which was set earlier.
